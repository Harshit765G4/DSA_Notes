# DSA

Logic folder includes LazyLogics That are used to basic Logic Learning
DSA Practice file Contains multiple Logic together in file That are commented to form another one
Currently solving some leetcode question so no new update on lazyLogic


Currently studying strings

today I solved leetcode 3516 find the closest person problem


solved 2749

class Solution {
 public:
  int makeTheIntegerZero(int num1, int num2) {
    // If k operations are used, num1 - [(num2 + 2^{i_1}) + (num2 + 2^{i_2}) +
    // ... + (num2 + 2^{i_k})] = 0. So, num1 - k * num2 = (2^{i_1} + 2^{i_2} +
    // ... + 2^{i_k}), where i_1, i_2, ..., i_k are in the range [0, 60].
    // Note that for any number x, we can use "x's bit count" operations to make
    // x equal to 0. Additionally, we can also use x operations to deduct x by
    // 2^0 (x times), which also results in 0.

    for (long ops = 0; ops <= 60; ++ops) {
      const long target = num1 - ops * num2;
      if (__builtin_popcountl(target) <= ops && ops <= target)
        return ops;
    }

    return -1;
  }
